# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: August 21, 2025_

This application (“the App”) is a personal project created and maintained by an individual developer. The App is intended solely for personal use to interact with the Pinterest API in order to manage and back up content from my own Pinterest account.

## Data Collection and Use
- The App may access Pinterest content, including images, pin metadata, and board information, through the official Pinterest API.  
- No personal data is collected from other users.  
- All retrieved content is used strictly for personal archival and organizational purposes.  
- The App does not process, analyze, or share data with any third party.

## Data Storage
- Data retrieved from the Pinterest API may be stored locally on my own devices for backup purposes.  
- No data is stored on external servers or shared with other services.  

## Security
- API keys and access tokens are stored securely and used only to authenticate my account with Pinterest.  
- Reasonable measures are taken to prevent unauthorized access to any locally stored data.  

## Third-Party Services
- The App uses the official Pinterest API to retrieve data.  
- No other third-party services are integrated.  

## Children’s Privacy
- The App is not directed toward children and does not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13.
